data for manuscript entitle "A flow-dependent targeted observations method for EnKF systems", including the model data of CTL and ASSIM runs.

# SLA_wmean_0001_0003_20_mem_CTL.mat
It is the SLA data for all three years in the CTL run (see section 3.2 for details). This is a 20-member ensemble simulation, with weekly mean output.
The variables "lon" and "lat" indicate the longitude and latitude information.

# SLA_wmean_0001_0003_analysis_err_var_ASSIM.mat
It is the analysis error variance of SLA, when the optimal observation array is assimilated (ASSIM run).
The variables "lon" and "lat" also indicate spatial information.
